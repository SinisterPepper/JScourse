		Empty spaces, what are we living for <br>
		Abandoned places, I guess we know the score <br>
		On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for <br>
		Another hero, another mindless crime<br>
		Behind the curtain, in the pantomime<br>
		Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore<br>
		The show must go on<br>
		The show must go on, yeah<br>
		Inside my heart is breaking<br>
		My make-up may be flaking<br>
		But my smile still stays on<br>
		Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance<br>
		Another heartache, another failed romance<br>
		On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?<br>
		I guess I'm learning (I'm learning learning learning)<br>
		I must be warmer now<br>
		I'll soon be turning (turning turning turning)<br>
		Round the corner now<br>
		Outside the dawn is breaking<br>
		But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free<br>
		The show must go on<br>
		The show must go on, yeah yeah<br>
		Ooh, inside my heart is breaking<br>
		My make-up may be flaking<br>
		But my smile still stays on<br>
		Yeah yeah, whoa wo oh oh<br>
		My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies<br>
		Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die<br>
		I can fly, my friends<br>
		The show must go on (go on, go on, go on) yeah yeah<br>
		The show must go on (go on, go on, go on)<br>
		I'll face it with a grin<br>
		I'm never giving in<br>
		On, with the show<br>
		Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill<br>
		I have to find the will to carry on<br>
		On with the show<br>
		On with the show<br>
		The show, the show must go on<br>
		Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on<br>
		Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on<br>
		Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on<br>
		Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on<br>
		Go on, go on
